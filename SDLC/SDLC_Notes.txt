=========================================
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
=========================================

=> From stat to end is called as Life Cycle

=> SDLC = Development + Testing + Deployment + Delivery 

=> From project start to till project end is called as Software development lifeycle.

=> We have several phases in SDLC


1) Requirements Gathering

2) Requirements Analysis

3) Design (FDD / BRD / SRS )

4) Development

5) Testing

6) Deployment

7) Delivery

8) Support (SLA - Service Line Agreement ) - 6 months

====================
SDLC Methodologies
====================

1) Waterfall (outdated)

2) Agile (Most Trending)


=======================
Waterfall methodology
=======================

-> Linear methodology (Sequential Process)

-> It is a step by step process

-> After one step is completed then only we will move to next step

-> Forward Direction

-> Client involement is very less

-> Client will see project at the end 

-> requirements fixed & budget fixed


==================
Agile Methodolgy
==================

-> Iterative approach

-> Development + Testing + Delivery - is a cyclic process

-> Project will be delivered in multiple phases (Sprint)

-> Client Involment will be there in every phase of the project

-> Requirements are not fixed & Budget is not fixed

Note: Client Satisfaction is most important factor in Agile Methodolgy
